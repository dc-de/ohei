# OHEI - openHABian EASY installer

OHEI is an openHABian EASY installer.
It prepares the Debian host for openHABian and installs it.
It also helps to fix the unsecured web UI.

*NOTE!*
The web UI username/password is only useful after the security patch!

**How to use OHEI:**

*1.*
`git clone https://github.com/dc-de/ohei.git`

*2.*
`cd ohei`

*3.*
`sudo chmod +x ohei.sh`

*4.*
`sudo ./ohei.sh`

*5.*
select option 1

*6.*
done!


The other options are optional, but the openHABian security patch is highly recommended to do!
